"""Stop hook: keep the agent working until the quality gates pass on its changes.

When the working tree has changed Python files (deletions included), this runs
what CI runs, in order: pre-commit on the files that still exist, the test suite
with branch coverage, and diff-cover at 100% of changed lines. The first failure
blocks the stop and hands its output back to the agent, so "done" means the
gates passed.

A turn with no changed Python costs nothing: the gates are skipped.

To avoid an endless loop on a failure the agent cannot fix, a stop that is
already a retry (``stop_hook_active``) goes through, with a visible warning to
the user that the work is not verified.

Usage, from ``.claude/settings.json``, run from the project root with the hook
event JSON on stdin:
    uv run --no-sync python tools/hooks/stop_gate.py
Exit status is always 0; the decision is the JSON written to stdout.
